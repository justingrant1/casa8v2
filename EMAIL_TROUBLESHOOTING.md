# Email Delivery Troubleshooting Guide

## Issue: EmailJS Reports Success But No Emails Received

Based on the console logs showing `Email notification sent successfully` but no actual emails being received, this is a common EmailJS configuration or deliverability issue.

## Common Causes & Solutions

### 1. EmailJS Service Configuration Issues

**Problem**: EmailJS service is not properly connected to your email provider.

**Solution**:
1. Go to [EmailJS Dashboard](https://dashboard.emailjs.com)
2. Navigate to Email Services
3. Verify your email service is properly connected:
   - Gmail: Check OAuth connection is active
   - Outlook: Verify credentials are correct
   - SMTP: Test connection settings
4. Look for any error messages or warnings

### 2. Email Template Issues

**Problem**: Template doesn't exist or has incorrect variable mappings.

**Solution**:
1. Go to Email Templates in EmailJS Dashboard
2. Verify template `template_contact` exists
3. Check template variables match your code:
   - `{{to_name}}` - Recipient name
   - `{{to_email}}` - Recipient email (should be in "To" field)
   - `{{from_name}}` - Sender name
   - `{{from_email}}` - Sender email
   - `{{property_title}}` - Property title
   - `{{message}}` - Message content
   - `{{reply_to}}` - Reply-to address

### 3. Email Service Provider Issues

**Problem**: Email service provider is blocking or limiting sends.

**Solution**:
1. Check your email service provider's sending limits
2. Verify your "from" email address is authorized
3. For Gmail: Check if less secure app access is enabled (if using password auth)
4. For Outlook: Verify app passwords are being used

### 4. Deliverability Issues

**Problem**: Emails are being sent but filtered as spam or blocked.

**Solution**:
1. Check spam/junk folders
2. Verify recipient email address is correct
3. Check if domain is blacklisted
4. Ensure proper SPF/DKIM records (for custom domains)

### 5. EmailJS Account Issues

**Problem**: EmailJS account limitations or suspension.

**Solution**:
1. Check EmailJS dashboard for account status
2. Verify you haven't exceeded free tier limits (200 emails/month)
3. Check for any billing issues
4. Review EmailJS service status page

## Debugging Steps

### Step 1: Test EmailJS Configuration
Run the diagnostic script:
```bash
# In browser console on your site
window.testEmailJS()
```

### Step 2: Check EmailJS Dashboard
1. Go to [EmailJS Dashboard](https://dashboard.emailjs.com)
2. Navigate to Email Services â†’ [Your Service]
3. Check "Test" tab to send a test email
4. Verify email is received

### Step 3: Verify Template Configuration
1. Go to Email Templates
2. Click on `template_contact`
3. Test the template with sample data
4. Ensure all variables are properly mapped

### Step 4: Check Email Service Status
1. In EmailJS Dashboard, go to Email Services
2. Look for any error indicators
3. Test the connection using EmailJS built-in tools

### Step 5: Review Logs
1. Check EmailJS dashboard logs for detailed error messages
2. Look for delivery failures or bounces
3. Check for quota exceeded messages

## Quick Fixes to Try

### Fix 1: Recreate Email Template
1. Delete existing `template_contact` template
2. Create new template with exact variable names
3. Test with a simple message first

### Fix 2: Try Different Email Service
1. If using Gmail, try Outlook or vice versa
2. Or use SMTP configuration with your email provider

### Fix 3: Update Environment Variables
Verify these are correct in your `.env.local`:
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_EMAILJS_PUBLIC_KEY=your_public_key
NEXT_PUBLIC_EMAILJS_SERVICE_ID=your_service_id
EMAILJS_PRIVATE_KEY=your_private_key
```

### Fix 4: Simplify Email Template
Create a minimal template first:
```
Subject: Test Email

Hello {{to_name}},

This is a test email from {{from_name}}.

Message: {{message}}

Best regards,
Casa8
```

## Alternative Solutions

### Option 1: Switch to Nodemailer (Server-side)
If EmailJS continues to have issues, consider implementing server-side email:

```typescript
// api/send-email/route.ts
import nodemailer from 'nodemailer'

export async function POST(request: Request) {
  const transporter = nodemailer.createTransporter({
    service: 'gmail',
    auth: {
      user: process.env.EMAIL_USER,
      pass: process.env.EMAIL_PASS
    }
  })

  // Send email logic
}
```

### Option 2: Use Resend or SendGrid
More reliable email services:
- [Resend](https://resend.com) - Modern email API
- [SendGrid](https://sendgrid.com) - Enterprise email service

3. **Long-term**: Consider migrating to server-side email solution for better reliability
